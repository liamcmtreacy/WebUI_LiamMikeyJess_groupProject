<h1> Free Willy 1993, by Simon Wincer</h1>
<h2> A Legacy of Freedom and Conservation</h2>

<p> The orca featured in the 1993 movie Free Willy was a real whale named Keiko, who became an icon for animal rights and the movement to end the captivity of marine mammals. Captured off the coast of Iceland when he was just two years old, Keiko spent over 20 years in various aquariums, where he was kept in small tanks and deprived of the space to swim freely. Despite his circumstances, Keiko became a star after appearing in the popular film.
