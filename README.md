# WebUI_LiamMikeyJess_groupProject
This is our group project for the 2025 Module "Web UI Design"
Our project is called "The World of Whales"
Our goal is produce an educational News Website about Whales, the site has an easy on the eyes color pallette

It is designed for people who enjoy these Aquatic creatures, and also people who want to learn about them.

# Design Rationale
We chose this theme and topic because we thought it would be interesting to talk about, the fact that it hasn't been done by other classmates, and also an element of challenge, as a Whales News site would cause us to search deep to find good information

# Key Features

Our site contains a Homepage, About Us Page, Whales in History page, Trending Whale News and Fun Facts page.

Our homepage has a gif playing in the background, and the option to subscribe to a newsletter, you can also play music which will play throughout the whole site
The About Us page has cards and a modal present, along with some slight animations when the page loads, 
The Fun Fact page has the option to submit your own fun facts

We also used a lot of Div classes to help make the coding process easier

# Responsiveness 

Responsiveness was one of the final things we worked on, we used different sized computer screens and tested it by shrhinking the screen size, we made text larger, sometimes when relevant we added more prominent borders and had the images be in a column format to be easier on the eyes

# Technologies Used

Svelte.js
HTML/CSS/JS
Github
Blackboard
Adobe Photoshop (Used to test different colors next to each other, to see what looked decent next to each other)
