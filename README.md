# WebUI_LiamMikeyJess_groupProject
This is our group project for the 2025 Module "Web UI Design"
Our project is called "The World of Whales"
Our goal is produce an educational News Website about Whales, the site has an easy on the eyes color pallette

It is designed for people who enjoy these Aquatic creatures, and also people who want to learn about them.
Live Link: 

# Design Rationale
We chose this theme and topic because we thought it would be interesting to talk about, the fact that it hasn't been done by other classmates, and also an element of challenge, as a Whales News site would cause us to search deep to find good information

# Key Features

Our site contains a Homepage, About Us Page, Whales in History page, Trending Whale News and Fun Facts page.

Our homepage has a gif playing in the background, and the option to subscribe to a newsletter, you can also play music which will play throughout the whole site
The About Us page has cards and a modal present, along with some slight animations when the page loads, 
The Fun Fact page has the option to submit your own fun facts

We also used a lot of Div classes to help make the coding process easier

# Responsiveness 

Responsiveness was one of the final things we worked on, we used different sized computer screens and tested it by shrhinking the screen size, we made text larger, sometimes when relevant we added more prominent borders and had the images be in a column format to be easier on the eyes

# Technologies Used

Svelte.js
HTML/CSS/JS
Github
Blackboard
Adobe Photoshop (Used to test different colors next to each other, to see what looked decent next to each other)

# Team Contributions

Jessica Curran (JessicaCurran): Style changes edits on pages, created freewilly article and completed it, edited information on other pages.

Mikey Holmes (Mikey-Holmes): Responsiveness on trending whales, whales in history, headers and fun facts page, general style edits throughout, added information on trending news page, edited style of fun facts page.

Liam Treacy (liamcmtreacy): Project Leader, designed the Home Page, About Us Page, wrote articles for Whales in History, helped with responsiveness, general code work and helping my team, added the ability to play audio and your own fun facts, added the ability to subscribe, pushed the website live.

# Deployment Section

Deploying the site proved to be quite a bit of trouble, we needed to have Libor research a method to export Gifs for us, which thankfully he was able too. The {base} was tough to first figure out but we got there in the end, pushing it live took a couple of tries, it turns out it would go live, but I forgot to add the .noJekyll file

# Errors

While the site runs fine, there is a few erros which I cannot figure out, the first is that not all nav links work on each page, I'm unsure why this is the case so sometimes you have to click onto a certain page to get back to another page. Also you need to click around a page or two before the buttons work, I feel this is something to do with the site not fully rendering but I am unsure.

# Reflections and What's Next

We all want to put this site out there and have our friends and family read it, we would like to attach this site to our CVs and show them around to potential employers in the future, overall we are proud of the site and hope to potentially improve it in 3rd year.

Right now we decided to take a short break and swiftly move onto our portfolio project which is next.
